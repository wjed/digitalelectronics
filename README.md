# IT 212 – Digital Electronics 🔌

This repository contains all my coursework, labs, and projects completed for **IT 212: Digital Electronics** at James Madison University.

## 📚 Course Overview
IT 212 covers the foundational concepts of digital logic systems, including number systems, combinational and sequential circuits, digital ICs, and logic circuit design using hardware and simulation tools.

Each lab includes:
- The **Python code** used to generate clock signals or support digital circuit behavior

## 🛠 Tools & Components
- SN74 series ICs (e.g., counters, decoders, inverters)
- Breadboard components (LEDs, resistors, wires)
- Raspberry Pi GPIO (for pulse generation via Python)
- Python (for GPIO control scripts)
- Logisim & Multisim (for circuit simulation when applicable)

## 📌 Notes

All code and designs are original and submitted for academic purposes only. If you are taking IT 212 or a similar course, use this as a **reference** only. Do not plagiarize or submit this work as your own.
